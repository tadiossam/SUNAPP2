- **spare_parts**: Comprehensive parts catalog with:
  - Compatibility, pricing, stock levels
  - 3D model paths
  - Multiple 2D images (array)
  - Manufacturing specifications (JSON): dimensions, material, tolerance, weight, CAD formats
  - Tutorial videos and animated tutorials
  - Location instructions and maintenance guides

### Design System
- **Theme**: Industrial Material Design 3 with light/dark mode support
- **Colors**: Professional blue primary (210 85% 45%), high contrast for readability

  - Apple-specific meta tags for iOS Safari
  - Touch-optimized viewport settings (user-scalable for accessibility)
  - Apple Touch Icon for home screen installation
  - Standalone app mode on iOS devices
  - Android Chrome web app capabilities
✅ Manufacturing specifications system:
  - Millimeter-precision dimensions (length, width, height, diameter)
  - Material specifications
  - Tolerance ratings
  - Weight specifications
  - CAD format availability (STL, STEP, GLTF, GLB)
  - Surface finish and hardness data
✅ Manufacturing specs component displaying CNC/milling/3D printing ready data
✅ 15+ professional stock images for D8R parts
✅ Animated tutorial support (GIF/WebM format for offline compatibility)
✅ 8 D8R parts populated with complete manufacturing specifications

### Phase 5 - AI Part Recognition (Pending)
⏳ OpenAI Vision integration for image-based part identification
⏳ "Identify Part" page with camera/upload functionality
⏳ AI-powered part matching with confidence scores

## Equipment Data
Master equipment list for **Sunshine Construction PLC** (30 units):

**DOZER Equipment (25 units):**
- 24x CAT D8R
- 1x KOMATSU D155A-5

**WHEEL LOADER Equipment (5 units):**
- 2x VOLVO (L-90C, L-120E)
- 2x CATERPILLAR (938F)
- 1x KOMATSU (938E-2)

All equipment includes plate numbers, asset numbers, new asset numbers, and machine serial numbers.

## Development Notes
- Using design_guidelines.md for consistent UI implementation
- Object storage configured for 3D model files (GLB/GLTF preferred)
- PostgreSQL database provisioned and ready
- All components follow accessibility best practices with data-testid attributes
- **PWA/Offline Support**: Service worker caches API responses, images, videos, and 3D models for offline access
- **Manufacturing Data**: All dimensions accurate to millimeter precision for CNC machining, milling, and 3D printing
- **Stock Images**: 15 professional industrial equipment images downloaded for parts catalog

## Authentication & Security
- **CEO Login Credentials:**
  - Username: `ceo`
  - Password: `ceo123` (⚠️ Change after first login!)
- **Admin Login Credentials:**
  - Username: `admin` / Password: `admin123` (⚠️ Change after first login!)
  - Username: `biruk` / Password: `Tolera123` - Biruk Tolera
- Session management with express-session
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Secure cookies enabled in production
- CEO/Admin roles required for equipment/parts/maintenance operations
- Admin actions trigger email notifications to CEO (tafestadios@gmail.com)
- Master equipment list protected from unauthorized modifications

## Email Notifications
- **Resend Integration**: Admin actions send notifications to CEO
- **Setup Required**: Configure RESEND_API_KEY environment variable to enable
- **Email Target**: tafestadios@gmail.com
- **Notifications Include**: Action type, record details, timestamp, who performed action

## Known Limitations
- **3D Model Rendering**: The 3D viewer currently displays a demonstration wireframe. Production implementation would require Three.js (@react-three/fiber) which had peer dependency conflicts with the current React 18 setup. The infrastructure is in place (model paths, upload system, viewer component) - only the Three.js renderer needs to be integrated when dependency conflicts are resolved.
