# Heavy Equipment Spare Parts Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive web application for industrial equipment maintenance, focusing on efficient management of heavy equipment inventory and spare parts. It features a detailed parts catalog with 3D models, streamlines searching and visualization, and integrates robust garage, equipment reception, and multi-level approval workflows to enhance maintenance operations and tracking. The project aims to significantly improve efficiency in heavy equipment maintenance.

**Sample Data System**: Comprehensive seeding capability creating 1000+ realistic sample records (50 employees, 100 equipment, 200 spare parts, 300 work orders, 100 requisitions with ~300 lines, 50 receptions/inspections, 100 performance snapshots, 100 archived orders from Ethiopian year 2017). Accessible via Admin Settings > Sample Data tab. Designed for offline/local deployments and testing all system features.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development with clear communication at each stage. Please ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or adding new external dependencies. I also prefer detailed explanations for complex technical decisions. Ensure all solutions are mobile-compatible, especially for iOS Safari.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system utilizes an Industrial Material Design 3 theme with light/dark modes, professional blue primary colors, and Inter/JetBrains Mono typography. It features sidebar navigation, responsive data-dense layouts, comprehensive accessibility, and an interactive 3D viewer for technical engineering drawings with millimeter-accurate dimensions, ISO 2768 tolerance standards, SVG annotations, and CAD export badges. Logo customization allows for company logo display on login and in the sidebar.

**Mobile Responsiveness**: Comprehensive mobile-first design across all pages with responsive patterns including: horizontal scrolling tabs using `inline-flex w-full min-w-max lg:grid` pattern, responsive grids with `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` breakpoints, and full-width form controls to prevent horizontal overflow. The ResponsiveFrame component handles iframe/3D viewer aspect-ratio preservation. All filter controls and data tables properly stack on mobile devices while maintaining multi-column layouts on desktop. Optimized for iOS Safari with proper touch targets and viewport handling.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query. The backend uses Express.js and Node.js, with PostgreSQL (Neon) and Drizzle ORM. Three.js is used for 3D rendering.

**Authentication & Access Control**: Employs JWT-based authentication and comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via a single `employees` table. Passwords are secured with bcrypt. The system includes case-insensitive role checks, admin superuser access, and helper functions for centralized role checking. Endpoints are protected based on roles such as `store_manager`, `verifier`, `supervisor`, `foreman`, and `team_member`. **Page-Level Access Control**: Granular employee page permissions via the `employee_page_permissions` table allow CEO/Admin users to restrict which pages individual employees can access through the "User Control" tab in Admin Settings. The sidebar navigation filters menu items based on user permissions; CEO and Admin users bypass all restrictions and always have full access. Permissions default to allowed when no explicit rule exists to prevent accidental lockouts. The application is a PWA optimized for mobile. Object storage for media and 3D models uses presigned URLs. Database queries are optimized with batch fetching. Work Order numbers use `WO-YYYY-XXX` format, Requisition numbers `REQ-YYYY-XXX`, and Purchase Order numbers `PO-YYYY-XXX`. Local media storage is organized under `public/uploads/` for employees, spare parts, and equipment.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard**: Dynamic analytics with real-time filtering, KPI cards, and charts.
- **Equipment Inventory**: CRUD operations for equipment categories and units. Includes D365 Fixed Asset import with intelligent description parsing.
- **Spare Parts Catalog**: Full CRUD operations for parts, advanced filtering, detailed information, and D365 BC Item import. Statistics cards show total, low, and out of stock items. **Stock Status Logic**: Automatically calculates stock status based on quantity: 0 = out_of_stock, 1-5 = low_stock, >5 = in_stock. This logic applies to all operations (create, update, and D365 import).
- **3D Models Library**: Interactive viewer with upload and 360-degree rotation.
- **Maintenance Information System**: Guides, tutorials, tools lists, and time estimates.
- **Garage & Workshop Management**: CRUD for hierarchical structures, including foreman and team assignments.
- **Employee Management**: Single-table authentication, RBAC, and bcrypt hashing.
- **Work Order Management**: Multi-level approval system and multi-workshop assignment. Features a redesigned form, team workflow (Foreman assigns → Team requests parts → Verification), and an Item Requisition System with multi-level approval (Team Member → Foreman → Store Manager) and per-line foreman approval. Automated purchase request creation for out-of-stock items. Includes a comprehensive approval chain (Team Member → Foreman → Verifier → Supervisor → Final Completion) and a detailed status flow, with participant tracking and status history. A Work Timer Tracking System automatically tracks work duration, pauses for waiting periods, and resumes when work continues. Automatic `parts_receipts` creation upon requisition approval.
- **Work Order Status Flow**: `pending_allocation` → `pending_foreman_assignment` → `pending_team_acceptance` → `in_progress` → `pending_verification` → `verified` → `completed`. Status may also transition to `awaiting_parts` or `waiting_purchase`.
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Dedicated dashboards for Store Managers, Foremen, Verifiers, and Team Performance pages with leaderboards.
- **Equipment Reception/Check-in**: Driver drop-off workflow with auto-generated reception numbers.
- **Equipment Maintenances Workflow**: Admin review for driver check-ins.
- **Equipment Inspection**: View of receptions, auto-generated inspection numbers, and service-type checklists.
- **Approval System**: Multi-level workflow for job orders, completions, parts requests, and inspections.
- **Item Requisition Forms**: Matches official forms with line-item descriptions, quantities, and multi-level signatures, including individual line-item approval for Store Managers with partial fulfillment and PO generation.
- **Employee Performance Tracking**: Gamification system with daily/monthly/yearly leaderboards based on completed work orders and average completion time.
- **Maintenance History**: Comprehensive equipment maintenance tracking page with searchable equipment selection, statistics cards, and clickable maintenance cards showing work order details.
- **Currency Conversion**: Dynamic USD/ETB conversion in the parts catalog.
- **Attendance Device Integration**: Integration with ZKTeco iFace990 Plus for employee management.
- **Deployment Tool**: Admin settings for server host/port configuration, saved to the database. Includes database schema export functionality.
- **Fleet Tracking System**: Real-time GPS tracking integration with MellaTech platform. Features include vehicle location tracking, trip history, fleet alerts monitoring, automatic data synchronization, and comprehensive fleet management dashboard. **Fleet Management Integration**: Admin Settings includes a "Fleet Management INT" tab showing MellaTech credential configuration status with "Test Connection" and "Sync Now" functionality. **Equipment Reception Auto-fill**: When equipment is selected during driver check-in, the system automatically queries the MellaTech API by plate number and auto-fills the kilometer reading field if GPS tracking data is available. Users receive informative toasts for all scenarios (data found, not found, or service unavailable). Credentials stored securely as environment variables (MELLATECH_USERNAME, MELLATECH_PASSWORD).
- **Ethiopian Year Management**: Bilingual system for managing yearly data based on Ethiopian calendar (13 months, New Year on Sept 11/12). Features automatic year detection, comprehensive year closure workflow with transactional safety, work order archiving (completed orders moved to `work_orders_archive` with Ethiopian year tracking), planning targets reset across all workshops, and year closure audit logging. Admin Settings includes "Ethiopian Year" tab showing current year info, automatic New Year detection based on Gregorian leap year calculations, and guided year closure process with clear warnings. The transactional year closure ensures atomicity - all operations (archive, delete, reset workshops, update settings) succeed or fail together, preventing data loss via specific ID tracking instead of status-based deletion. Year closure logs track statistics (orders archived, workshops reset) for audit trail. **Planning Targets Locking**: Workshop planning targets (monthly, quarterly, annual) are locked in Edit Workshop dialogs based on `planningTargetsLocked` system setting. Targets can only be modified during new year setup after Year Closure. Lock status displayed with amber Alert banner explaining the restriction. **Parts Receipts Preservation**: The `parts_receipts` table no longer has a CASCADE DELETE foreign key constraint on `work_order_id`, ensuring historical spare parts data is preserved when work orders are archived during year closure. Parts receipts remain queryable via `originalWorkOrderId` in archived orders.
