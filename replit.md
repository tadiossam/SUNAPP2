# Heavy Equipment Spare Parts Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive web application designed for industrial equipment maintenance teams to efficiently manage heavy equipment inventory and spare parts. The system features a detailed parts catalog with 3D models and compatibility information, streamlines searching, browsing, and visualization of spare parts, and incorporates robust garage, equipment reception, and multi-level approval workflows to enhance maintenance operations and tracking. The project's vision is to significantly improve efficiency in heavy equipment maintenance.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development with clear communication at each stage. Please ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or adding new external dependencies. I also prefer detailed explanations for complex technical decisions. Ensure all solutions are mobile-compatible, especially for iOS Safari.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system employs an Industrial Material Design 3 theme, supporting light/dark modes with professional blue primary colors and Inter/JetBrains Mono typography. It features sidebar navigation, responsive data-dense layouts, comprehensive accessibility, and an interactive 3D viewer. Technical engineering drawings with millimeter-accurate dimensions, ISO 2768 tolerance standards, SVG annotations, and CAD export badges are provided via a CNC Milling Precision Viewer.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend uses React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query. The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js, utilizing PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM. Three.js powers 3D rendering. Authentication is JWT-based with role-based access control using a single `employees` table (roles: ceo, admin, supervisor, mechanic, technician, electrician, painter, body_worker, wash_employee, user, **verifier**, **store_manager**), with passwords secured by bcrypt. The application is a Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile. Manufacturing specifications include detailed dimensions, material, tolerance, weight, CAD formats (STL, STEP, GLTF, GLB), surface finish, and hardness data. Object storage for media and 3D models is handled by Replit Object Storage via Google Cloud Storage using presigned URLs. Database queries are optimized with batch fetching (`inArray()`) to prevent N+1 issues. Work Order numbers are generated using MAX suffix extraction with a flexible regex (`/WO-\d{4}-(\d+)/`) to prevent duplicates. Requisition numbers follow pattern REQ-YYYY-XXX and purchase order numbers follow PO-YYYY-XXX.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard**: Dynamic analytics with real-time filtering, KPI cards (total work orders, accomplishment rate, cost), and various charts (quarterly performance, trends, cost distribution, workshop comparison). Auto-calculates direct, overtime, outsource, and overhead costs.
- **Equipment Inventory**: CRUD operations for equipment categories and units, flexible assignment, and real-time UI updates. Category pages include banners, unit display, search, and detailed modals.
- **Spare Parts Catalog**: Advanced filtering, detailed part modals with specs, compatibility, and media.
- **3D Models Library**: Interactive viewer with upload and 360-degree rotation.
- **Maintenance Information System**: Comprehensive guides, tutorials, tools lists, and time estimates.
- **Garage & Workshop Management**: CRUD for garages (main categories) and workshops within them, including foreman and team member assignments. Garages page displays workshops hierarchically within each garage card.
- **Employee Management**: Single-table authentication via `employees` table, role-based access control, and bcrypt password hashing.
- **Work Order Management (REDESIGNED WORKFLOW)**: Complete redesign with multi-level approval system and multi-workshop assignment:
  - **Multi-Workshop Assignment**: Work orders can be assigned to multiple garages and workshops simultaneously using checkbox selection dialog showing hierarchical garage→workshop relationships. Frontend sends garageIds and workshopIds arrays; backend stores in work_order_garages and work_order_workshops junction tables.
  - **Work Order Form (Redesigned)**: Removed all deprecated fields (assignedToIds, estimatedHours, estimatedCost, scheduledDate, notes). Implements multi-garage/workshop selection dialog with real-time garage/workshop loading when editing existing work orders via `/api/work-orders/:id/assignments` endpoint.
  - **Team Workflow**: Workshop foreman receives work orders → assigns to team members → team requests parts → completion verification
  - **Item Requisition System**: Bilingual (Amharic/English) parts request form with multi-level approval (Team Member → Foreman → Store Manager)
  - **Purchase Order Integration**: Automatic purchase request creation for out-of-stock items with "waiting for purchase" status
  - **Approval Chain**: Team Member completes → Foreman → Verifier (quality control) → Supervisor → Final completion
  - **Work Order Status Flow**: draft → pending_foreman_assignment → pending_team_acceptance → active → awaiting_parts → waiting_purchase → in_progress → pending_verification → pending_supervisor → completed
  - **Participant Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of all foremen, team members, verifiers, and store managers involved in each work order
  - **Status History**: Complete audit trail of all status changes with timestamps and responsible employees
  - **Role-Specific Dashboards**: 
    - **Store Manager Dashboard** (`/store-manager`): Pending parts requisitions with approve/reject actions, recent activity feed, quick stats
    - **Foreman Dashboard** (`/foreman`): Work orders pending team assignment, team member selection, assignment tracking
    - **Verifier Dashboard** (`/verifier`): Work orders pending quality verification, approval/rejection with notes
    - **Team Performance Page** (`/team-performance`): Daily/Monthly/Yearly leaderboards with performance scores, top performers displayed without emoji (using Lucide icons only per design guidelines)
- **Equipment Reception/Check-in**: Driver drop-off workflow with equipment selection, driver details, arrival info, issues, and auto-generated reception numbers.
- **Equipment Maintenances Workflow**: Admin review page for driver check-ins, allowing updates and status changes.
- **Equipment Inspection**: View of receptions, auto-generated inspection numbers, service-type checklists (Amharic), and an Inspection-to-Work-Order workflow where completed inspections trigger approval, leading to auto-created work orders.
- **Approval System**: Multi-level workflow for job orders, completions, parts requests, and inspections, with department hierarchy and approval dashboards.
- **Item Requisition Forms**: Matches the official Sunshine Construction PLC requisition form (translated from Amharic) with:
  - Requisition number (REQ-YYYY-XXX format)
  - Requesting workshop/department
  - Line items: Description, Unit of Measure, Quantity, Remarks
  - Multi-level signatures: Requester → Foreman → Store Manager
  - Partial approval support (line-by-line status tracking)
- **Employee Performance Tracking**: Gamification system with daily/monthly/yearly leaderboards:
  - Performance scores based on completed tasks and work orders
  - Employee of the Month/Year awards
  - Individual performance dashboards showing daily progress
  - Login page displays top performers with achievement details
  - Metrics tracked: tasks completed, labor hours, quality scores, requisitions processed
- **Currency Conversion**: Dynamic USD/ETB conversion in the parts catalog.
- **Attendance Device Integration**: Integration with ZKTeco iFace990 Plus via LAN-based TCP/IP for employee user management, including configuration, import, sync, and mapping.

## External Dependencies
- **Replit Object Storage**: For 3D models, images, and videos.
- **Neon**: PostgreSQL database hosting.
- **Resend**: Email notification service.
- **ZKTeco Biometric Device**: iFace990 Plus attendance device, utilizing the `zkteco-js` library.
