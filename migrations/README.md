# Database Migrations

This folder contains SQL migration files generated by Drizzle Kit.

## How Migrations Work

When you run `GENERATE-MIGRATION.bat`, Drizzle compares your `shared/schema.ts` 
with your database and generates SQL files here that represent the changes needed.

## Files

- `0000_*.sql` - Migration SQL files (numbered in order)
- `meta/_journal.json` - Migration tracking metadata

## Usage

1. **Generate migrations:** Run `GENERATE-MIGRATION.bat`
2. **Review SQL:** Check the generated .sql files
3. **Apply migrations:** Run `APPLY-MIGRATIONS.bat`

## Important

- Don't manually edit these files
- Commit them to Git if working with a team
- Each migration runs only once (tracked by Drizzle)

## Alternative: Quick Sync (Advanced Only)

For experienced users working on simple additive changes only:
```
UPDATE-DATABASE-SCHEMA.bat
```

WARNING: Quick sync is only safe for additive changes (new tables/columns).
Use migration files for any breaking changes to avoid data loss.

See `DATABASE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` for complete safety guidelines.
